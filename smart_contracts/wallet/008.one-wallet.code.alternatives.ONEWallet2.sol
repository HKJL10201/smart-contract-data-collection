     * Note: It is important that the operations are submitted along the commit hash due to security property:
     *   - the design is inspired by 3-stage protocol for replacing root hash in SmartOTPs; however, here we merge stages 1 and 2 into a single (since 3 stages would be impractical).
     *   - we are making the 1st valid entry in the list of commits for current OTP interval => we commit to the commit hash and its operation parameters at the single step (in contrast to SmartOTPs doing it in 2 steps).
     *   - a valid OTP + proof in reveal() can lead only to exection of the valid operation (1st one in the list).
     *   - if here would be submitted only hash of commit, it can be front-runned by the attacker (as also pointed-out by Aaron)

     * Note: the current design shows the detials of the operation that will be executed in maximally ~60 seconds, which might be seen as a premature leakage of 
     *       transaction details. However, for the standard wallet use cases (e.g., presented here) this should not be an issue.
