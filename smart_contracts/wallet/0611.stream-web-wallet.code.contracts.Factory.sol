This is achieved by deploying (via CREATE2) a proxy contract with fixed content and to have the proxy contract pointing to the actual implementation contract (which its address does depend on the bytecode). This approach has two downsides: (1) unlike CREATE2, the client would not be able to verify the contract does contain the intended code simply by verifying the address is as expected. (2) the use of proxy and fallback mechanisms make debugging harder and may introduce unexpected behaviors
