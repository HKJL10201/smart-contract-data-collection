// This is the final task: The implementation of the Smart Contract Wallet ðŸ’¸
// These are the requirements:
//      The wallet has one owner
//      The wallet should be able to receive funds, no matter what
//      It is possible for the owner to spend funds on any kind of address, no matter if its a so-called Externally Owned Account (EOA - with a private key), or a Contract Address.
//      It should be possible to allow certain people to spend up to a certain amount of funds.
//      It should be possible to set the owner to a different address by a minimum of 3 out of 5 guardians, in case funds are lost.
