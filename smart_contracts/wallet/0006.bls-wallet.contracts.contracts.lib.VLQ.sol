/**
 * Variable Length Quantity
 * 
 * An unsigned integer format that provides an efficient representation of small
 * values while allowing for unlimited size (except for the 256bit limit in this
 * context).
 * 
 * The first (highest) bit of each byte indicates whether to continue reading.
 * The other 7 bits are used as a big-endian representation of the number.
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * 0x00: 0
 * 0x01: 1
 * 0x7f: 127
 * 0x8100: 128
 * 0x8105: 133 = 1 * 128 + 5
 * 0x838005: 49,157 = 3 * 128^2 + 0 * 128^1 + 5 * 128^0
