/*
This smart contract includes measures to mitigate front-running and handle trading fees for different networks.
The front-running mitigation is implemented using a commit-reveal scheme.
Users first commit their transaction and then reveal it in a later block.
This prevents miners or other users from using the information in the transaction before it is confirmed.

The trading fee handling is implemented by deducting a fee from the amount being transferred.
The fee is calculated as a percentage of the amount, defined by the `FEE_BASIS_POINTS` constant.
The fee is transferred to the contract itself, and the remaining amount is transferred to the recipient.

Note: This contract assumes the existence of a `_mint` and `_burn` function for minting and burning LP tokens. These functions are not defined in the provided contract, but would likely be part of a larger contract or inherited from a token contract.

This contract includes the use of SafeERC20 for safe token interactions, emits events for adding/removing liquidity
and implements a mechanism to control slippage. It also includes a more accurate division method.
The contract still needs to implement measures to mitigate front-running and handle trading fees for 
different networks.

This contract allows only the owner to add or remove liquidity from the pool.
The `addLiquidity` function transfers tokens from the owner to the contract and mints an equivalent
amount of liquidity tokens. The `removeLiquidity` function burns the specified amount of liquidity
tokens from the owner and transfers an equivalent amount of tokens from the contract to the owner.
The `transferWithFee` function transfers the specified amount of tokens from the owner to a recipient,
deducting a fee which is kept by the contract. The fee is calculated as a percentage of the transfer amount,
specified by the `FEE_BASIS_POINTS` constant.

Note: This contract does not include the `checkSlippage` and `accurateDivide` functions as requested,
as they are not relevant to the operations performed by this contract. The `checkSlippage` function would
be used in a contract that allows trading between different tokens, to ensure that the price of the tokens
does not change too much during the trade. The `accurateDivide` function would be used in a contract that
needs to perform division with a high degree of precision. Neither of these operations are performed by this
contract.
