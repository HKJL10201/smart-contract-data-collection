/**
 * @title BucketLender
 * @author dYdX
 *
 * On-chain shared lender that allows anyone to deposit tokens into this contract to be used to
 * lend tokens for a particular margin position.
 *
 * - Each bucket has three variables:
 *   - Available Amount
 *     - The available amount of tokens that the bucket has to lend out
 *   - Outstanding Principal
 *     - The amount of principal that the bucket is responsible for in the margin position
 *   - Weight
 *     - Used to keep track of each account's weighted ownership within a bucket
 *     - Relative weight between buckets is meaningless
 *     - Only accounts' relative weight within a bucket matters
 *
 * - Token Deposits:
 *   - Go into a particular bucket, determined by time since the start of the position
 *     - If the position has not started: bucket = 0
 *     - If the position has started:     bucket = ceiling(time_since_start / BUCKET_TIME)
 *     - This is always the highest bucket; no higher bucket yet exists
 *   - Increase the bucket's Available Amount
 *   - Increase the bucket's weight and the account's weight in that bucket
 *
 * - Token Withdrawals:
 *   - Can be from any bucket with available amount
 *   - Decrease the bucket's Available Amount
 *   - Decrease the bucket's weight and the account's weight in that bucket
 *
 * - Increasing the Position (Lending):
 *   - The lowest buckets with Available Amount are used first
 *   - Decreases Available Amount
 *   - Increases Outstanding Principal
 *
 * - Decreasing the Position (Being Paid-Back)
 *   - The highest buckets with Outstanding Principal are paid back first
 *   - Decreases Outstanding Principal
 *   - Increases Available Amount
 *
 *
 * - Over time, this gives highest interest rates to earlier buckets, but disallows withdrawals from
 *   those buckets for a longer period of time.
 * - Deposits in the same bucket earn the same interest rate.
 * - Lenders can withdraw their funds at any time if they are not being lent (and are therefore not
 *   making the maximum interest).
 * - The highest bucket with Outstanding Principal is always less-than-or-equal-to the lowest bucket
     with Available Amount
